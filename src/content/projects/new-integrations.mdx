## Procore - NetSuite ![Procore](/src/assets/images/procore.png)

I've taken on the new responsibility of being the primary developer and customer support person for Calance's Procore NetSuite ERP integrations. This line of integrations currently has around 20 clients. I expanded the functionality by adding new C# / .NET integrations to send owner / prime contract invoices from Procore to NetSuite, as well as commitment / subcontractor invoices.

## City of Seattle ![Seattle](/src/assets/images/seattle.png)

I am currently helping the City of Seattle Parks and Recreation department automate their subcontractor invoice process. This has involved listening for a webhook from Procore and programatically generating an Excel spreadsheet from data within Procore and then converting it to .pdf called a pay estimate form.

The next phase of planned work will be to create a small full stack web app with React, TypeScript, and C# / .NET Core that will run as an iFrame embedded within the Procore website. This app will allow the city's subcontractors to fill out 3 different types of forms. The data will be stored in Amazon Web Services DynamoDB, and later read and added to the pay estimate form.
