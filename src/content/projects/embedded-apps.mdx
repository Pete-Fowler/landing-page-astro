## Budget Forecast by Cost Code

I recently created a full stack web app that is embedded within the Procore website as an iFrame using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, C# / .NET, and Amazon Web Services DynamoDB. This app was developed for clients that want to see budget forecasts by cost code and edit the forecasted amounts as well as notes, which is not possible in Procore natively.
