I completely rebuilt our team's customer facing web app in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, C# / .NET Core, and Amazon Web Services. The old version was written in vanilla JavaScript and C# / .NET Framework with the Nancy web framework. Key features include configuring, scheduling, running, and monitoring data integrations, as well as manually linking and unlinking specific records. The site uses Amazon Web Services including S3, RDS, Lambda, and EventBridge.

One of the major improvements was converting the legacy task scheduling system, which relied on Windows Task Scheduler, into a more robust, scalable, reliable, and cross-platform solution using AWS Lambda and EventBridge. A constraint of this project was a directive to copy the old version of the site's appearance and to avoid spending any time on design improvements. However, I was able to implement a number of user interface enhancements, and we received customer feedback that the new version seems faster and more intuitive.
