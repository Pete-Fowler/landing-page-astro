I led a complete rebuild of our team's customer facing web app in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, C# / .NET Core, and Amazon Web Services. The old version was written in vanilla JavaScript and C# / .NET Framework with the Nancy web framework.

The site uses Json Web Tokens for authentication and authorization. It is a site where clients can configure, schedule, run, and monitor data integrations, as well as manually link and unlink specific records.

No proprietary data is shown for this demo/mock company
