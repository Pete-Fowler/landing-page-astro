This was a complete rebuild of our team's customer facing web app in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, C# / .NET Core, and Amazon Web Services. The old version was written in vanilla JavaScript and C# / .NET Framework with the Nancy web framework. Features include configuring, scheduling, running, and monitoring data integrations, as well as manually linking and unlinking specific records.

No proprietary data is shown for this demo/mock company.
