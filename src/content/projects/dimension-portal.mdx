This was a complete rebuild of our team's customer facing web app in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, C# / .NET Core, and Amazon Web Services. The old version was written in vanilla JavaScript and C# / .NET Framework with the Nancy web framework. Features include configuring, scheduling, running, and monitoring data integrations, as well as manually linking and unlinking specific records.
